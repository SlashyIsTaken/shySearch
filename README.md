ESX | Criminal Search Script

# Overview
This script enables criminals who don't have access to some sort of criminal menu to still be able to perform player searches.<br>
The way it works: The nearest player gets a notification saying someone wants to search them, and presents them with 2 options. 1: Accept to get searched, and 2: Decline the search request. If the player accepts, his inventory will become visible to the armed robber, via an ESX or OX menu.
